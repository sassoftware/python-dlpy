DLPy: SAS Deep Learning Python API
**********************************

What is DLPy?
=============
DLPy is a high-level package for the Python APIs created for the SAS Viya 3.3 (and newer) Deep Learning and Image action sets. DLPy provides a convenient way to perform deep learning image processing. DLPy uses a familiar Keras-style Python API to access and utilize SAS Viya Deep Learning actions in the SAS Cloud Analytic
Services (CAS) environment. Users who are new to SAS CAS programming, but are familiar with other opensource
deep learning packages, can use the intuitive DLPy interface to run Keras code (with very few
modifications) to smoothly access SAS analytic and deep learning actions in the SAS CAS environment.

The new DLPy package is mainly designed for image classification problems using Convolutional Neural
Network (CNN) models. DLPy currently enables GPU support, but on an experimental basis. New support for
Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and object detection is under development, and will be added to the DLPy
package in future releases.


Installing DLPy
===============
SAS provides APIs designed for use with Python 2.7 and Python 3.4. Both are available on the GitHub repository here: https://github.com/sassoftware/dlpy/releases.

Note: To enable graphic visualizations of DLPy deep learning models, it is recommended that you download and install the open source graph visualization software called Graphviz. Graphviz is available here: https://www.graphviz.org/download/

The Graphviz Python package has very few dependencies. All of the dependencies are included in Anaconda Python.

To install DLPy, open an operating system console, navigate to the folder location where you downloaded DLPy, and submit the following::

    pip install dlpy


Getting Started with DLPy
=========================
Before you can use the DLPy package, you will need a running SAS CAS server and the SWAT (SAS Scripting Wrapper for Analytics Transfer) package. SWAT enables you to access and interact with SAS CAS. The SWAT package can connect to the binary port or the HTTP port of your CAS host. For best performance, use the binary port.

In addition to the CAS host and port information, you need a CAS userID and password to connect. See your system administrator for details if you do not have a CAS account.

To connect to a CAS server, import SWAT and use the swat.CAS class to create a connection::

    >>> import swat
    >>> sess = swat.CAS(host="cloud.example.com", port=5570, userid="user-ID", password="user-ID-password")
	
Next, import the DLPy package, and then build a simple convolutional neural network (CNN) model.

Import DLPy model functions::

    >>> from dlpy import Model, Sequential

Import DLPy layer functions::

    >>> from dlpy.layers import *

Import DLPy application functions::

    >>> from dlpy.applications import *
	
Use DLPy to create a sequential model and name it 'Simple_CNN'::

    >>> model1 = Sequential(sess, model_table = 'Simple_CNN')
	
Now define an input layer to add to model1::

    # The input shape contains RGB images (3 channels)
    # The model images are 224 px in height and 224 px in width

    >>> model1.add(InputLayer(3,224,224))

    NOTE: Input layer added.
	
Now, add a 2D convolution layer and a pooling layer::

    # Add 2-Dimensional Convolution Layer to model1
    # that has 8 filters and a kernel size of 7. 

    >>> model1.add(Conv2d(8,7)

    NOTE: Convolutional layer added.

    # Add Pooling Layer of size 2

    >>> model1.add(Pooling(2))

    NOTE: Pooling layer added.
    
Now, add an additional pair of 2D convolution and pooling layers::

    # Add another 2D convolution Layer that has 8 filters
    # and a kernel size of 7 

    >>> model1.add(Conv2d(8,7)

    NOTE: Convolutional layer added.

    # Add a pooling layer of size 2 to # complete the second pair of layers. 
    
    >>> model1.add(Pooling(2))

    NOTE: Pooling layer added.
    
Add a fully connected layer::

    # Add Fully-Connected Layer with 16 units
    
    >>> model1.add(Dense(16))

    NOTE: Fully-connected layer added.
    
Finally, add the output layer::

    # Add an output layer that has 2 nodes and uses
    # the Softmax activation function 
    
    >>> model1.add(OutputLayer(act='softmax',n=2))

    NOTE: Output layer added.
    NOTE: Model compiled successfully 
    
Display a print summary of the table::

    # Display a brief summary table of model1
    
    >>> model1.print_summary()
